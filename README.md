Summary of costs including shipping, but not taxes:

Updated final cost of the build =
Reddit helped me save $\_\_

And here is everything I've learned so far:

- Combine 3D prints (using sprues) where possible, since printing multiple items at the same time lowers costs
- Try to have/design a reversible PCB as it lowers costs
- FDM is a better process for flat shapes/finishes, while Resin is better for curved shapes/finishes
- Local 3DP shops typically charge per weight/time, rather than by file count like JLCPCB

This is an incredible community, thanks for all your help! Hopefully this post helps someone out there like it helped me :)
