# TOTEM_build_resources

TOTEM part links from my personal build and some helpful tips I picked up from the r/ErgoMechKeyboards community!

(Tried to keep formatting similar to the official guide by GEIST for simplicity)

Grand Total = $

Reddit not only helped me save $75.01 but I got **_WAY_** more parts for my money that can be used for future builds!

And here are some things I learned along the way:

- Combine 3D prints (using sprues) where possible, since printing multiple items at the same time lowers costs
- Try to have/design a reversible PCB as it lowers costs
- FDM is a better process for flat shapes/finishes, while Resin is better for curved shapes/finishes
- Local 3DP shops typically charge per weight/time, rather than by file count like JLCPCB

This is an incredible community, thanks for all your help! Hopefully this post helps someone out there like it helped me :)
